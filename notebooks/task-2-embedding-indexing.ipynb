    "Foundational vectorization and semantic indexing of complaint narratives for **CrediTrust Financial’s Intelligent Complaint Analysis Initiative**. This notebook transforms cleaned consumer complaints into numerical embeddings using pre-trained transformer models and builds a scalable FAISS index to enable semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Outputs from this task will power intelligent querying and automated summarization in Task 3.\n",
